# Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous: Dragon Mod

The base game has a mythic path that lets you become a gold dragon. 
But it comes quite late in the game and it really just complements your existing build.
What if you could start the game as a dragon with lore-accurate stats?
If this sounds appealing, then this mod is for you!

This is a work-in-progress mod that adds a custom Dragon class, inspired by the [Half Dragon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/half-dragon/) template and the [True Dragon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon/) statblocks.
